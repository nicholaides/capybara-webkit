capybara-webkit
===============

A [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) driver that uses [WebKit](http://webkit.org) via [QtWebKit](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qtwebkit.html).

Dependencies
------------

capybara-webkit depends on a WebKit implementation from Qt, a cross-platform development toolkit. You'll need to download the Qt Framework to build and install the gem.

* [Download Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/downloads)

If you're on OS X, the installer at the above link will set up everything you need. You can download just the framework, as the full SDK isn't required to build the gem. We recommend downloading the non-Debug Cocoa package with just the framework. Note that installing Qt via homebrew takes more than an hour, so we recommend just downloading the precompiled framework for OS X.

If you're on Ubuntu, you can install the libqt4-dev package.

On Linux platforms, capybara-webkit requires an X server to run, although it doesn't create any visible windows. Xvfb works fine for this. You can setup Xvfb yourself and set a DISPLAY variable, or try out the [headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless).

Usage
-----

Add the capybara-webkit gem to your Gemfile:

    gem "capybara-webkit"

Set your Capybara Javascript driver to webkit:

    Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit

Tag scenarios with @javascript to run them using a headless WebKit browser.
